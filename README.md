# Chain-O-Plant_chainlink_hackathon
Chain-O-Plant where O stands for the ecosystem, it's a dapp focused to boost environment and local art that is getting lost in this supercomputer era.

## High level overview of our system - 

```
1. ERC20 token "Greencoin" - This is created to tokenise whole ecosystem, transaction fees and everything will be done by this. Each minting of token 
will led to the plantation of tree. 
2. Marketplace for local artists - This section provide local and budding artists to showcase their art through NFT's.
3. Lottery- In this we will use chainlink random number generator, through which in every slot a random number will get generated and winner will take the prize money
and some part of it will be used for the plantation of tree.
4. Plant a "Plant" - This section provide you dedicate a plant with name, description and the latitude and longitude of plant will be shared with chainlink oracalise,
so that you can see the exact location of it.
